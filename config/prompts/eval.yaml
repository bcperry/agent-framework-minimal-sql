      For SQL discovery tasks, expected trajectory is usually:
      list_views -> describe_table -> read_query.
      Penalize direct read_query when schema/columns are unknown.

      If score is below threshold, explain:
      - which expected tool call(s) were missing,
      - which incorrect tool call(s) were made,
      - whether ordering/trajectory was inappropriate.
